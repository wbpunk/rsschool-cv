# About me:

#### My name is Alexey Matiyuk, I am a beginner Frontend JavaScript developer. I have a great desire to learn, learn new things, and constantly improve my skills in the area I study. I love immersing myself in the process of learning a new topic, writing, improving code or an application, looking for different ways to solve problems given to me in the best and fastest way. Every day I don’t stand still, but learn something new and interesting to me, for example, various foreign languages (Norwegian, Polish, English). I am currently taking a course... After completing the course I plan to get a job at EPAM. I am doing and will do everything possible to achieve my goal.

## My skills
#### I have some experience with the Python language (If you evaluate the level of a foreign language, it is approximately A1), the Go programming language (About A2 level) and of course JavaScript (B1 level).
#### I also worked with the Version Control System (Git), GitHub, Google ChromeDev.
#### The frameworks I used were:
#### 1. PyCharm
#### 2. WebStorm
#### 3. GoLand
#### 4. DataGrip
#### 5. Visual Studio Code
#### I also have skills in using Linux (Linux Mint)
