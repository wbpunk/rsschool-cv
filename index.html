    <h2>
      My name is Alexey Matiyuk, I am a beginner Frontend JavaScript developer.
      I have a great desire to learn, learn new things, and constantly improve
      my skills in the area I study. I love immersing myself in the process of
      learning a new topic, writing, improving code or an application, looking
      for different ways to solve problems given to me in the best and fastest
      way. Every day I donâ€™t stand still, but learn something new and
      interesting to me, for example, various foreign languages (Norwegian,
      Polish, English). I am currently taking a course RS SCHOOL FE/RU. After
      completing the course I plan to get a job at EPAM. I am doing and will do
      everything possible to achieve my goal.
